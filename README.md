## :scroll: Description
Timer app features an iconic animated digital style numbers that decrements as seconds go by.

It also has an animated circular progress indicating the timing left.

You can choose between 6 different options to start the timer.

The app has beautiful animations all along. From the point you press **Start** to the point
where timer completes.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
When the timer is about 5 seconds before complete, the screen flashes in **red** indicating
that it's about to complete, so that you can easily get back the focus to the app if you're looking away.
